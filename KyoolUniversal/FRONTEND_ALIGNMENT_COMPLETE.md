# React Native Frontend Alignment - COMPLETED

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished**

Your React Native app in `KyoolUniversal` has been **completely aligned** with your working frontend website. The React Native app now follows the exact same patterns, API calls, user flows, and component structure as your successful web application.

- ✅ **Environment configuration** - Proper BASE_URL handling for web/mobile

### **2. Authentication Flow Overhaul**
- ✅ **`SignUpScreen.tsx`** - Complete rewrite matching `frontend/SignUpPage.tsx`
  - Full user profile creation with BMI/BMR/TDEE calculations
  - Username validation and availability checking
  - Google Sign In integration with backend sync
  - Comprehensive form with gender, age, height, weight, activity level
  
- ✅ **`LoginScreen.tsx`** - Updated to match `frontend/LoginPage.tsx`
  - Google Sign In with backend user verification
  - Proper routing to SignUp if user doesn't exist in database
  - Visual design matching frontend gradient style

### **3. Health Utilities & Calculations**

## 🔄 **Backend Synchronization**

Your React Native app now has **perfect backend synchronization**:

1. **Firebase Auth** creates the authentication user
2. **Backend API** creates the complete user profile with all health data
3. **Profile fetching** loads real user data instead of mock data
4. **Backwards compatibility** handles existing Firebase users without backend profiles
